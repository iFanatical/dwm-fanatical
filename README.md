Custom dwm configuration

Scripts used in this dwm configuration are located under my bash-scripts repository.\
This DWM configuration assumes you have a path configured for your scripts.\
In my case, I have an export variable under .common_env in my home directory.\
This variable is SCRIPTS=$HOME/.local/bin.\
.common_env is then sourced by .zshenv or .bash_profile.\


Included patches are:\
actualfullscreen\
alpha\
alwayscenter\
attachasideandbelow\
colorbar\
focusmaster\
focusmonmouse\
pertag\
removeborder\
stacker\
vanitygaps
